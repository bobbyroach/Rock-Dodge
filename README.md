# Rock-Dodge
Simple game created using javascript, html, and css

This is my first project starting from scratch and while the game is pretty simple and the code is pretty messy, I'm still proud that I was able to create the game I originally imagined with minimal outside help (from the internet).

It involves moving a character around a 9 by 9 grid where rocks are falling on random tiles. If the character is touching a rock when it has reached its intended tile, the player loses. If the character dodges a rock, it is reset to a fall on another random tile. As the game progesses, the speed at which the rocks fall increases and so does the amount of rocks that fall, making the game exponentially harder the longer it goes on. 

There is still much to be improved on in this game and as I learn more I hope to revisit the code for this game and make the coding more efficient and readable, because a good amount of the code could be abstracted and the overall design could be much better.

Here's a short clip of the gameplay:
