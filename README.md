# Rock-Dodge
Simple video game created using javascript, html, and css

This game involves moving a character around a 9 by 9 grid where rocks are falling on random tiles. If the character is touching a rock when it has reached its intended tile, the player loses. If the character dodges a rock, it is reset to a fall on another random tile. As the game progesses, the speed at which the rocks fall increases and so does the amount of rocks that fall, making the game exponentially harder the longer it goes on.
